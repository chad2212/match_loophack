== for{loop}


For{loop} is a non-profit incubator with the purpose of bridging the economic divide across the Delmar Boulevard by encouraging investment in businesses led by underprivileged entrepreneurs. We accomplish this through our pop-up shop program, where we provide vacant lots on Delmar to entrepreneurs in the hopes that they gain experience and confidence in the development of their own business skills.


In order to run the site for you

* Ruby version 2.2.1

* Uses PostgreSQL so need to create a user and password and put them into the *database.yml*
* Besure to run <tt>bundle install</tt> <tt>rake db:setup</tt> and <tt>rake db:migrate</tt>
* run 'rails s' to start up the server
* open up a browser (tested on chrome and safari) and go to 'localhost:3000'
